# VEngine

From time to time I like playing with the idea of building a 2d platform game engine, mostly to learn stuff and have some fun. This is one of my tries in C++.

## Run
Right now I haven't tested this on anything else beside MSVC 2022 on Windows, using vcpkg as a package manager.

```
vcpkg install sdl2-gfx:x64-windows sdl2-image:x64-windows sdl2-ttf:x64-windows
vcpkg install fmt:x64-windows
vcpkg install boost-chrono:x64-windows boost-log:x64-windows boost-statechart:x64-windows boost-locale:x64-windows
```
